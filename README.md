# What's ParkinsonAI?

ParkinsonAI is the Swift Playground App project that I prepared as an interactive demo that uses machine learning to analyze the hand tremor, sounds, and handwriting to detect Parkinson's disease. It is also a short presentation that explains what Parkinson's is and how it affects people.
